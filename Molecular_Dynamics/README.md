==================
Implementation of the simulated annealing and replica exchange Monte Carlo algorithms for protein folding in the HP model
in Python (2.7.6) and using NumPy library (1.8.0).

Hydrophobic-polar protein folding (HP) model is used in the study of the general principles of protein folding.
The idea of the HP model is based on the observation that a key role in the process of folding
has the hydrophobic effect - tendency of hydrophobic amino acids to aggregate and 'hide' from the water molecules.
Amino acids are over the alphabet {H,P}, where H is hydrophobic and P polar amino acid
and they are located on the square lattice.

Metropolisâ€“Hastings algorithm is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method that allows 
sampling the set of possible configurations of protein, according to any probability distribution (here the Boltzmann distribution). The algorithm generates a Markov chain in which each state x^{t+1} depends only on the previous state x^t. The algorithm uses a proposal density Q(x'; x^t ), which depends on the current state x^t, to generate a new proposed sample x'. This proposal is "accepted" as the next value (x^{t+1}=x') if \alpha drawn from U(0,1) satisfies.

<h2> 1. Replica exchange Monte Carlo </h2>

Usage:
<pre><code>$ python replica_exchange.py</pre></code>
Output is the trajectory of replica at the lowest temperature in the pdb format.


<h2> 2. Simulated annealing </h2>

Usage:
<pre><code>$ python simulated_annealing.py</pre></code>
Output is the trajectory in the pdb format.

<h2> 3. Visualization </h2>

You can visualizate trajectory in the pdb format using PyMOL:
<pre><code>$ pymol trajectory.pdb</pre></code>
and then in PyMOL console:

<pre><code>PyMOL> run show</pre></code>
